    <h1>Washinton</h1>
    <p>
      Up until this point we had plenty of long distance experience but I knew
      when I left you behind in washington things would be different. Gone were
      the days of spontaneous weekend trips to Phoenix. We were now separated by
      about 1,089 miles, and would go months without seeing each other. Facetime
      became our best friend and mortal enemy. However my love for you never
      wavered and slowly but surely made it through that period of our
      relationship.
